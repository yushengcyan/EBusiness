## JsViews: Next-generation MVVM and MVP framework - bringing templates to life
_The power of MVVM, the flexibility of JavaScript, the speed and ease of JsRender templates_<br/>

**JsViews** builds on top of **[JsRender](http://jsviews.com/#jsrender)** templates, and adds data-binding and **[observable data](http://jsviews.com/#jsobservable)**, to provide
 a fully-fledged MVVM platform for easily creating interactive data-driven single page apps and websites.

**JSRender** and **JsViews** together provide the next-generation implementation of both _JQuery Templates_, and _JQuery Data Link_ - and supersede those libraries.
